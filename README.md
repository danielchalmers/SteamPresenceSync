# Presence Sync for Steam

This app monitors your Steam gaming activity and automatically updates your Steam Friends status:
- When you start playing a game (AppID â‰  0), your status is set to **Online**
- When you close the game (AppID = 0), your status is set back to **Offline**

## How It Works

The application uses Windows registry change notifications to monitor the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Valve\Steam\RunningAppID` registry key. When Steam launches or closes a game, the registry value changes and triggers an event, which the application responds to. This event-based approach means the application only runs when changes occur, not constantly polling. It uses the Steam browser protocol (`steam://friends/status/...`) to update your status.
