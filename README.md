# Steam-Presence-Sync
Automatically toggle your Steam friends list status as you play ‚Äî let friends know when you're gaming, then vanish when you quit

## Overview
Steam Presence Sync is a Windows background application that monitors your Steam gaming activity and automatically updates your Steam Friends status:
- When you start playing a game (AppID ‚â† 0), your status is set to **Online**
- When you close the game (AppID = 0), your status is set back to **Offline**

## Features
- üéÆ **Automatic Status Management**: Seamlessly toggles your Steam status based on game activity
- ‚ö° **Event-Based Monitoring**: Uses Windows registry change notifications instead of polling - no constant CPU usage
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Smart Debounce**: Instantly goes online when a game starts, but waits 60 seconds after closing to see if you launch another game
- üîÑ **Retry Logic**: Attempts up to 3 times with exponential backoff to ensure status changes succeed
- üìù **Comprehensive Logging**: All actions are logged with timestamps for easy monitoring
- ü™ü **Background Operation**: Runs quietly in the background with no UI

## How It Works
The application uses Windows registry change notifications to monitor the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Valve\Steam\RunningAppID` registry key. When Steam launches or closes a game, the registry value changes and triggers an event, which the application responds to. This event-based approach means the application only runs when changes occur, not constantly polling. It uses the Steam browser protocol (`steam://friends/status/...`) to update your status.
